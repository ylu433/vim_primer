Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not:
nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not;
unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of
educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
    - Calvin Coolidge
